# Craft's 3D POC

The scale and intention of this project will change with time, it began as a learning exercise.

## Concept 1 Notes: Basic Scene

Borrows heavily from [SimonDevs YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEwhtpXrg5MmwlH04ANpL8A) and [Github](https://github.com/simondevyoutube/ThreeJS_Tutorial_BasicWorld)

Includes:

- Skybox

  - Found this to hit performance pretty hard as we are rendering the same static images every time

- Perspective camera with an orbit controller

- Rendering an object or three into the scene
